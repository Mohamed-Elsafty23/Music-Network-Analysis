MUSIC COVER NETWORK MODEL SPECIFICATION
================================================================================

MODEL OVERVIEW:
Name: Music Cover Influence Network
Type: Directed Graph
Theoretical Basis: Cultural Diffusion and Artistic Influence Theory

NODE DEFINITION:
----------------------------------------
entity_type: Musical Artists/Musicians
identifier: artist_id (unique integer)

PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTES:
  common_name: Artist primary name
  artist_type: Type of artist (individual, group, etc.)
  home_country: Country of origin
  birth_year: Year of birth (for individuals)
  career_span: Years of active musical career
  genre_affiliation: Primary musical genres

DERIVED_ATTRIBUTES:
  influence_score: Calculated based on number of covers received
  diversity_index: Breadth of artists they cover
  temporal_activity: Distribution of activity over time
  collaboration_index: Frequency of collaborative works
  cultural_reach: Geographic spread of influence

NETWORK_METRICS:
  in_degree: Number of artists covering this artist
  out_degree: Number of artists this artist covers
  betweenness_centrality: Bridge role in cultural transmission
  closeness_centrality: Distance to other artists in network
  pagerank: Overall influence in the network
justification: 
            Artists as nodes represent the fundamental creative units in the music ecosystem.
            Each artist contributes unique cultural content while also being influenced by others.
            This aligns with Brandes et al.'s emphasis on entities that can both transmit and 
            receive information in complex networks.
            


EDGE DEFINITION:
----------------------------------------
relationship_type: Cover Performance Relationship
direction: Directed (Original Artist -> Covering Artist)
interpretation: Musical influence and cultural transmission

EDGE_ATTRIBUTES:
  song_title: Name of the covered song
  original_year: Year of original song release
  cover_year: Year of cover performance
  time_gap: Years between original and cover
  genre_similarity: Measure of genre overlap
  geographic_distance: Cultural/geographic distance between artists

WEIGHT_CALCULATION:
  method: Composite scoring based on multiple factors
  factors: ['Temporal proximity (recent covers weighted higher)', 'Commercial success indicators', 'Critical acclaim measures', 'Cross-genre influence bonus', 'International influence bonus']

EDGE_TYPES:
  direct_cover: Simple artist A covers artist B
  collaborative_cover: Multiple artists cover single original
  cross_temporal: Covers spanning different eras
  cross_cultural: Covers crossing national/cultural boundaries
justification: 
            Cover relationships represent direct evidence of artistic influence and cultural 
            transmission. The directed nature captures the temporal flow of influence from 
            original to cover. This model aligns with network science principles of 
            information flow and cultural diffusion (Brandes et al., 2013).
            


THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION:
----------------------------------------

        THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR MUSIC COVER NETWORK MODEL

        1. NETWORK SCIENCE FOUNDATION (Brandes et al., 2013):
           - Networks as formal representations of complex systems
           - Emphasis on relational data and structural patterns
           - Focus on emergent properties from local interactions

        2. CULTURAL DIFFUSION THEORY:
           - Musical covers represent documented cultural transmission
           - Artists as cultural agents in information networks
           - Temporal dynamics of influence propagation

        3. EMPIRICAL ADVANTAGES:
           - Objective, measurable relationships (cover performances)
           - Temporal ordering provides direction
           - Rich metadata for relationship characterization
           - Scalable to large datasets

        4. ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES:
           - Influence flow analysis through network paths
           - Community detection for musical genres/scenes
           - Temporal evolution of musical trends
           - Cross-cultural influence patterns
           - Artist importance ranking via centrality measures

        5. RESEARCH APPLICATIONS:
           - Cultural studies and musicology
           - Recommendation system development
           - Trend prediction and analysis
           - Social network analysis in creative industries
           - Computational creativity research

        This model effectively captures the complex web of musical influence while
        remaining computationally tractable and theoretically grounded.
